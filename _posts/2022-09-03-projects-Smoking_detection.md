## 1. Introduction   
Pros of smoke detection by image processing technology is that smoke detection is possible in a large range of detection and a long distance than smoke sensor.   
Smoke detection method is roughly divided into dectection for smoke and detection for cigarette.   
(피는 행위를 하는가, 그게 담배인가)로 나눠서 detect.   

   
빠르고 정확하게 탐지하기 위해서 single-stage detection을 사용함.  
YOLOV5 algorithm.
